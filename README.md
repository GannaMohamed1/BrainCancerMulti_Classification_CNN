## Brain Tumor MRI Classification with CNN 
This project implements a TensorFlow/Keras CNN model to classify brain tumor MRI scans into multiple categories (e.g., glioma, meningioma). Achieves 95% validation accuracy using optimized Conv2D, 
BatchNorm, and Dropout layers. Features data preprocessing (image resizing, 80/20 splits) with OpenCV and splitfolders, model training/evaluation, and performance visualizations. 
Ideal for exploring medical image analysis and deep learning workflows. Clone the repo to replicate results or contribute enhancements!
